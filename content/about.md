# Informal Bioinformatics Seminars

These seminars vary a lot, from highly technical and statistical discussions to light introductions to new technologies and methods like single cell genomics, image informatics and targeted proteomics. This is very much in line with a broad definition of bioinformatics. Put it simply if you have data and you are using it to understand and explain biological phenomena you are the target audience.

I hope that these seminars will also bring more appreciation that “bioinformatics” skills and knowledge are not discrete or even continuous in one dimension, and they don’t all belong to a single individual. Data analysis varies a lot in complexity and almost always better done as a collaboration. The methods and tools do vary between various disciplines, however more often than not, the overall analytical reasoning is highly transferable between fields of science.
