## Abstract

RNA Sequencing allows researchers to study the cancer genome from different perspectives than just differential expression analyses. For example, RNA-Seq is used to detect fusion genes, differentially spliced genes and by its own nature it can also be used to call mutations, a key component in the study of cancer. This also makes RNA-Seq a cost effective choice in cancer research. In this talk I will discuss the bioinformatics tools that I used to develop a pipeline to call variants from RNA-Seq samples and that was applied to several cohorts of Leukemia samples (https://github.com/annaquaglieri16/RNA-seq-variant-calling). I will also discuss pros and cons that were found using different callers as well as strategies and R packages to analyse and explore time-course mutations using samples extracted from the same patient over the course of the treatment (https://github.com/ChristofferFlensburg/superFreq, https://github.com/annaquaglieri16/lineplots).
