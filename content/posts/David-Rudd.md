## Abstract

Bowel cancer is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer for both men and women in Australia. Unfortunately, bowel cancer has a high prevalence of metastasis, which often occurs before or shortly after diagnosis due to patients seeking medical help at later symptomatic stages. When metastasis does occur, about 50% of these patients will experience metastasis in the liver, which is often unresponsive to current treatments. There is an urgent need for reliable risk predictive markers for primary and recurrent liver metastasis in patients diagnosed with bowel cancer. Previous research has discovered two particular proteins play a significant role in the control of tumour survival and spread. Our research is looking for additional correlative markers to add to predictive protein markers in a colorectal cancer (CRC) and liver metastasis (LM) cohort of patients with confirmed disease progression. Serum lipids are being profiled across patients with CRC, CRC + LM and controls to compared to proteome data and clinical data with patient outcomes. Over 500 individual lipids have been measured in serum samples and we are now looking to determine the effect of disease state, age, sex and clinical diagnosis on lipid composition prior to comparison to proteome data.
