## Abstract

High-throughput data generation technologies are driving discovery in biomedical science. But how do we learn about biology from the deluge of raw data? When we want to get accurate answers to important questions: Methods matter. We need specialised statistical and machine-learning tools to analyse large, complex, structured datasets. I will provide some intuition into the models that we use and talk about how statisticians think about biological data analysis challenges. Focusing on my favourites, I'll discuss a couple of examples in RNA-seq and single-cell genomics. Technical content will be relatively light with plenty of opportunity for discussion. BIO: Davis started in Bioinformatics as a UROP student (and Honours student, and RA) with Gordon Smyth in the Bioinformatics Division at WEHI. He worked on differential expression methods for RNA-seq data, most notably the edgeR package. He completed a DPhil in Statistics at the University of Oxford under the supervision of Prof Peter Donnelly, before undertaking a postdoc in Dr Oliver Stegle's group at the European Bioinformatics Institute in Cambridge, UK. At EBI, Davis worked on single-cell methods development and on projects linking DNA variation to single-cell gene expression. He returned to Melbourne in late 2018 to start the Bioinformatics and Cellular Genomics group at St Vincent's Institute of Medical Research, joint with Melbourne Integrative Genomics at the University of Melbourne.
