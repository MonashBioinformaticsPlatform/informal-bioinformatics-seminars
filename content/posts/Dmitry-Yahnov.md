## Abstract

Version control is a type of system that allows you to keep track of changes made to your code over time. As coding is an integral aspect of data science, it is best practice to use version control to maintain source code and digital assets, which also streamlines collaborative projects. Git is one of the most popular version control systems and in conjunction with services like Github facilitates version control for your projects. I will talk about Git essentials, workflow and best practices.
