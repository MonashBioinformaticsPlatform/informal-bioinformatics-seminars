## Abstract

Unbiased detection of protein–protein and protein–RNA interactions within ribonucleoprotein complexes are enabled through crosslinking with mass spectrometry, but different methods detect different types of molecular interactions. Accordingly, data analysis and interpretation requires the usage of different software packages with limited compatibility. In this talk, I will present crisscrosslinkeR, an R package that we developed to map both protein–protein and protein–RNA interactions from different types of mass spectrometry experiments. crisscrosslinkeR detects protein–RNA interactions from UV crosslinking with tandem proteolysis and mass spectroscopy (RBDmap) and protein–protein interactions from chemical crosslinking mass spectrometry (XL-MS), and maps them to protein sequences and structures. I will discuss the features using data related to an RNA-binding epigenetic modifier complex, the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2). I will demonstrate how this package has elucidated interactions between PRC2 and its cofactor proteins and RNA.
