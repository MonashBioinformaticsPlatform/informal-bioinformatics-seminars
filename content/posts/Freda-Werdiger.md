## Abstract

Building a robust model for disease is a necessary part of developing a cure. Respiratory medicine has long suffered from a difficulty in obtaining meaningful, easy-to-interpret, and robust quantitative information on lung function. X-ray velocimetry (XV), a novel technique which gathers information on both lung structure and function in a non-invasive fashion provides the opportunity for extensive research into therapies for respiratory illness such as cystic fibrosis and asthma. In this talk, I will outline the current and ongoing efforts into transforming XV data into useful models of disease and adapting these lengthy and manual processes for big data via automation and content-aware image processing.
