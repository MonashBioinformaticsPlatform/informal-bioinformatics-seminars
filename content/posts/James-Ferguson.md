## Abstract

The management of raw nanopore sequencing data poses a challenge that must be overcome to accelerate the development of new bioinformatics algorithms predicated on signal analysis. SquiggleKit is a toolkit for manipulating and interrogating raw nanopore data that simplifies file handling, data extraction, visualisation, and signal processing. Its modular tools can be used to reduce file numbers and memory footprint, identify poly-A tails, target barcodes, adapters, and find sequence motifs in raw nanopore signal, amongst other applications.
