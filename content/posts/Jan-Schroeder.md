## Abstract

Integration of miR-196 and retinoic acid signaling in limb development and patterning Retinoic acid signaling can be inhibited with a drug treatment. In conjunction with loss of miR-196 micro-RNAs this leads to malformations during limb development. We study this interaction in mouse embryos to investigate the overall mechanism. I present some bioinformatics challenges faced when analysing the data.
