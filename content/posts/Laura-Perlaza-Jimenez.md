## Abstract

Epidemiology studies using whole genome sequencing (WGS) have been popularized because they allow a very detailed association of phenotypes to a range of genomic components, as well as they allow the initial classification of isolates with higher accuracy than traditional methods. However, the main advantage of WGS methods is the ability to identify evolution and transmission patterns of outbreaks, which in many cases are questions impossible to access with traditional methods. In this talk we will discuss some strategies to extract the most out of genomic data from outbreaks. Specifically, methods to determine transmission, evolution and identification of resistant and virulent factors will be discussed using Klebsiella as an example.
