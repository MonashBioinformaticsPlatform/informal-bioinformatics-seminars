## Abstract

With the increased adoption of genomic technologies in an increasingly diverse range of industries there is more need than ever for bioinformatics support.  One key example is in clinical genomics where hospitals are often underfunded to have in-house bioinformatics specialists.  The Australian Genome Research Facility is a non-profit organisation providing sequencing and bioinformatics services to academic institutions, hospitals and across the private sector. In this discussion I will talk about how AGRF bioinformatics operate and the diversity of services and project types we take on. In particular I will focus on our recent move into clinical genomics, how we achieved our NATA accreditation and how these accreditations are key to enabling health research in Australia. I will also touch on the ways in which we operate differently to academic institutions as a consultancy.
