## Abstract

To date, the focus of post genome wide association studies (post-GWAS) has been the impact of regulatory variants on the expression of protein-coding genes. However, stronger risk variants are frequently dismissed as causal because they do not fall in regions marked for enhancer or promoter activity. Variants identified by GWAS are predominantly noncoding and enriched in regulatory elements but the contribution of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) is unknown. Using targeted RNA sequencing and de novo assembly combined with eQTL analysis and Capture Hi-C technology we systematically annotated lncRNAs transcribed from breast cancer GWAS loci and assessed their contribution to risk. We compiled the largest catalogue of breast cancer associated lncRNAs and provided evidence that modulation of lncRNAs by risk-associated variants is an alternative mechanism underlying breast cancer (and likely other complex traits). â€œ
