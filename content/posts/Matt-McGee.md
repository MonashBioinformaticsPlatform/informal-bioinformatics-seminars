## Abstract

Genome-wide association studies typically focus on discovery of one or more SNPs correlated with a phenotype of interest. However, complex haplotype variation may not easily decompose to individual SNPs, and statistical power may be severely impacted in dense genotype datasets. Here I present an alternative approach based on networks of identity-by-descent genome segments, which generalizes both to genome-wide association and traditional QTL mapping. I use this technique to map ecological and skeletal traits in a large and diverse vertebrate group.
