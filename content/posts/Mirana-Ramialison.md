Dr. Mirana Ramialison\
Group Leader of the Systems Developmental Biology laboratory at the Australian Regenerative Medicine Institute\
Her laboratory designs software and custom-made bioinformatics pipelines to decipher developmental gene regulatory networks, and validates their predictions using the zebrafish and Medaka fish model systems.

## Abstract

Bioinformatics is a highly collaborative field involving a diverse range of expertise from computing, statistics, mathematics and biology. Here I will be reflecting on the challenges and good practices encountered in achieving successful collaborations.
