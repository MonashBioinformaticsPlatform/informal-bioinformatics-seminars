## Abstract

An understanding of spatial gene expression and regulation is key to uncovering developmental and physiological processes, and accordingly, disease processes. Numerous techniques exist to gain gene expression and regulation information, but very few utilise intuitive true-to-life imaging methods to analyse and present their results. Here, we have deciphered the three-dimensional position and regulation of every gene expressed in the mouse heart. Our study has unveiled the specific subsets of genes that play an essential role in specific organ sub-compartments. We have also created a freely available web-based user interface for spatial transcriptome analysis and visualisation. The application may be accessed from http://3d-cardiomics.erc.monash.edu
