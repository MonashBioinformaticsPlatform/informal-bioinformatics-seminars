## Abstract

ASPREE (ASPrin in reducing effects of the elderly) is a large prospective cohort study looking at the effects of low-dose aspirin in an otherwise healthy elderly population. This is an enormous study with a vast number of measures taken at recruitment and follow up. This included biospecimens such as blood. Clonal haematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) is the phenomenon of mutations in genes associated with haematological abnormality being present in the bloodstream of people with no overt pathology. However, persons with CHIP have increased risk of cardiovascular disease and progression to leukaemia. With blood samples taken from ASPREE study participants at baseline and three years later, it is possible to look in detail using targeted amplicon deep sequencing, the prevalence of CHIP in this cohort and the changes, if any, over time. One could then associate these with clinical and phenotypical endpoints available within the ASPREE study. I will discuss the ongoing work in progress in this project which commenced this year. I will articulate the challenges involved both in the laboratory and in future, in the bioinformatics analyses of this large cohort.
