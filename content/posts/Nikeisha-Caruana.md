## Abstract

Sepiadariidae are a small species of benthic bobtail squid distributed along the Southern Indo-Pacific coast of Australia. Currently two known genera exist – Sepiadarium and Sepioloidea, both of which have been noted to emit large volumes of viscous slime when stressed. In order to identify key proteins involved in the function of Sepiadariid slimes, a combination of annotated de novo transcriptomics, used as a reference database, and quantitative proteomics was used. These results were combined with histochemical, immunohistochemical and ultrastructure methodology to highlight the mechanisms of secretion from Sepiadariidae. While the consistency of the slime is mucus-like, we were unable to identify any mucin proteins, the protein responsible for the high water holding capacity and gel-like consistency of similar secretions. We discovered that the slime from Sepiadariidae is a complex collection of bioactive molecules, including proteases, hormones and likely immune defence proteins. Proteomic methods highlighted several highly abundant, short, secreted proteins occurring in both Sepiadarium austrinum and Sepioloidea lineolata. While these proteins in both species had similarity between their sequences, no other information on the proteins could be ascertained. As a result, it is likely that these proteins highlight a novel protein family within the Sepiadariidae species, which is important to the function of the slime. Histochemistry also identified large (1mm in diameter) glands found on the surface of the ventral mantle in Sepioloidea lineolata. The enzymatic slime and uniqueness of the glands makes these secretions of particular interest for biomimetic investigation.
