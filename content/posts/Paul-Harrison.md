## Abstract

In this talk I will describe ranking and selecting differentially expressed genes based on confidence bounds on the log fold change, while still properly adjusting for multiple-testing, using my Bioconductor package "topconfects". The method is especially useful when many differentially expressed genes are discovered and need to be ranked by interest level, but degrades gracefully if there are few or poor-quality samples. More generally, I will talk about False Coverage-statement Rate adjustment, which is a general method for calculating confidence intervals for selected results, and the wider context of ongoing criticism of p-values and efforts to move away from their use.

## Bio

Paul Harrison completed his PhD in computer science at Monash University in 2006, joining the Victorian Bioinformatics Consortium at Monash University as he was finishing his PhD. In 2015 he joined the newly formed Monash Bioinformatics Platform. Paul has a long running collaboration with the Beilharz lab, which focusses on 3'-end dynamics of mRNA, and has also been involved in developing and teaching R workshops run by the Platform and the Monash Data Fluency initiative.
