## Abstract

Long-read sequencing platforms from Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) are transforming the world of genome assembly. While assemblies from short Illumina reads will almost certainly result in fragmented contigs, ONT reads can deliver complete assemblies (one contig per replicon) for bacterial genomes. In this talk, I will give practical recommendations for long-read assembly: how to QC reads, which tools to use and where things can go wrong. I will also discuss how Illumina and Nanopore reads can be used together to achieve the best possible bacterial genome assemblies.
