VCGS, Victorian Clinical Genetics Service

As one of the largest genetic pathology laboratories in Australia, the Victorian Clinical Genetics Services is on the forefront of much of what is going on in the the world of clinical genomics and the associated bioinformatics. In the space of just a few years we have gone from doing single gene tests via Sanger sequencing to now being one of the few providers in the world to clinically accredit whole genome sequencing for diagnostic use. In this talk, I’ll give an insight into what it means to be a bioinformatician in the middle of a turbulent clinical genomics environment:  keeping up with the latest technology while ensuring consistently high quality is delivered to patients and staying within the requirements of regulatory bodies for clinical work. I will give a number of examples of the work that VCGS clinical bioinformaticians do, ranging from infrastructure development and operational tasks through to genuine research and development to develop new assays. I’ll also touch on the value of clinical genomics and how it has the potential to give bioinformaticians a stable career with a meaning and value to ordinary people that is difficult to find anywhere else.
