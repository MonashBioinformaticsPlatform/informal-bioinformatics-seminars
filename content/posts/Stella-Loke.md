## Abstract

Nanopore sequencing has been marketed as the all portable, cheap and easy to answer to long reads. Sequencing for people. But is it? Can the novice really expect to climb to the top of Mount Kilimanjaro and produce 1Mb reads?  How realistic are the data outputs? Are the error rates a deal-breaker? Are you going to kill your flow cell and waste $1000? Let's talk frankly about Nanopore sequencing.  If you are interested in using Nanopore sequencing or hoping to improve your data output I have some realistic and practical answers for you.
