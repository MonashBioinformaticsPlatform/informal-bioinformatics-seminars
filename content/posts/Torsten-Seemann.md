## Abstract

Advances in whole genome sequencing and bioinformatics have transformed public health and clinical microbiology.  This talk will describe how genomics is used to detect and solve outbreaks more quickly, accurately and cheaper than ever before; and the key role bioinformatics methods are playing in aiding human health in a world where millions of samples are being generated in real time annually.
